- scrolling -> narrative
    - narrative = audio, scroll X/Y
    - when/then 
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic
    - 'scroll in from right when the user gets there'
- tone.js for playing back individual tracks
    - visualize with FFT, https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/FFT.html
    - https://tonejs.github.io/examples/player.html
- idea: collaborative trackmaking
- CSS grid: build overlay
- 
it's not a social media platform

next steps:
finalize text & content
- later: take images
think about & draw layout
- make overlay for grid and 4px baseline grid
- do not use elm-ui
- 
- 
pitfall: do not restart transport, restart the players on loop
